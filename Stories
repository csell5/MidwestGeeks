- A midwest geek wants to find an event close to his/her parent’s basement so he/she goes to MidwestGeeks.net, pulls up a map, zooms in/out on a map to see events closet to him/her. He/she clicks an event’s pin and a window pops up detailing (event name, website, address, meeting date(s), topics etc) the event.
(this assumes we have addresses for events)

- A hipster midwest geek only cares about JavaScript topics (obviously) so he/she goes to MidwestGeeks.net to find events relevant to JavaScript. The hipster geek enters ‘JavaScript’ into a filter/search box and only events relevant to JavaScript are returned (If .NET topics are returned MidwestGeeks.net loses all hipster cred). The filtered  results can be returned as a list of events by name, filtered entries in a calendar, or a map with only JavaScript relevent events as pins.

- A midwest geek wants to plan out his/her summer event schedule. The geek goes to MidwestGeeks.net and is overloaded with awesome events happening every weekend and every third Thursday in Grayslake, IL @7pm. This midwest geek enjoys whitespace so he/she filters for Python but there are still too many results so he/she clicks (drags/drops) a few items to his/her ‘My Events’. When he/she views ‘My Events’ a calender (or other type of visual…I’m just rambling now) appears showing on items dragged to ‘My Events’.
